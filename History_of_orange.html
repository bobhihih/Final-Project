 <h1>The History of the Color Orange</h1>
<p>The orange color was used in art in ancient cultures. Ancient Egyptians used the realgar mineral to create orange paint for their tombs, and orpiment was used in illuminated manuscripts during the Medieval period. The orpiment mineral was used to make orange pigment and was a popular trade item in Ancient Rome and a type of medicine in China.</p>
<p>The name “orange” was given to the color in the 16th century — it was called “saffron” or “yellow-red” previously. When Portuguese merchants brought orange trees to Europe from Asia in the late 15th and early 16th centuries, the citrus fruit’s name was adopted for the general color.(<a href="https://www.hunterlab.com/blog/the-color-orange/#:~:text=The%20name%20“orange”%20was%20given,adopted%20for%20the%20general%20color." target="_blank" title="Read more about the history of orange">source</a>)</p>
