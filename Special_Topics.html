        <h2>Copyright Rules</h2>
        <p>Understanding copyright laws is crucial for web designers to avoid legal issues. Copyright protects original works of authorship, including websites and their content. It is important to use only content (images, text, music) that is licensed for use, or to create original content. Familiarize yourself with Creative Commons licenses, which allow creators to communicate which rights they reserve, and which they waive for the benefit of other creators.</p>
